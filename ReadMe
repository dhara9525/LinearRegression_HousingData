In this folder Project1_Main_Program.m is primary project which reads file housing_price_data.dat. This program has three output graph. Initial plotting, iteration vs error and projection line graph. Screen shot of command window is also in this folder. Initial learning rate is 0.45 which takes 125 iterations to converge. By changing learning rate we get different iterations required for convergence. 


In this folder Project1_DiffernetLearningRate.m is secondary program which reads file DiffLearningRate.dat. Output of this program is also included in the folder. Objective if this program is to display that how many number of iterations	are required for different learning rate.
